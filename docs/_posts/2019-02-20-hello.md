`React` and the `ReactDOM` libraries using script tags, like this:

```html
<html>
<head>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@15/dist/react.min.js"> </script><script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@15/dist/react-dom.min.js">
</script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6.15.0/babel.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="text/babel">

    /*
    ADD REACT CODE HERE
    */

    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

1. The `<div>` with the id of `#root`. This is the entry point for our app. This is where our entire app will live.
1. The `<script type="text/babel">` tag in the body. This is where we’ll write our React.js code.

```javascript
class Hello extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <h1>Hello world!</h1>;
    }
}
```

It results in the following:

{% include elements/highlight.html text="A component can change its internal state directly. It can not change 

> Note: To make this work, we also had to bind the `this` keyword to the `updateMessage` method. Otherwise we couldn’t have accessed `this` in the method.



The **updateMessage** method then calls **this.setState()** which changes the `this.state.message` value. And when we click the button, here’s how that will play out:

1. **“If it isn’t tested, it’s broken”**  
    Write lots of tests, especially unit tests, or you’ll regret it.
1. **Choose meaningful names**  
    Use short and precise names for variables, classes, and functions.
1. **Classes and functions should be small and obey the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
    Functions should be no more than 4 lines and classes no more than 100 lines. Yep, you read that correctly. 
1. **Functions should have no side effects**  
    Side effects (e.g., modifying an input argument) are evil. Make sure not to have them in your code.
